Test Chrome extension for cats and dogs lovers.

The extension, if it is enabled globally and if it is enabled for a specific webpage, amend the content on it according to the following rules:
- If user loves only cats – every “dog” is replaced with a “cat”
- If user loves only dogs – every “cat” is replaced with a “dog”
- In case the user loves both, or does not care for either – don't do anything

The extension highlights every “dog” and “cat” word on the webpage depending on user preference.

When any highlighted word is clicked, a popup window with a random picture of the corresponding animal appears.
